Here's a restructured version of the provided instructions:

1. Begin by utilizing the Checkra1n jailbreak tool.
2. Establish a tunnel to SSH into your Apple device via USB using iproxy. This can be achieved by specifying the address as 2222 and most likely using port 44 or 22. (Example: iproxy 2222 44)
3. SSH into your device through the created tunnel. Use the command: ssh root@localhost -p 2222. If prompted for a password, the default could be 'alpine'.
4. Now, you're able to mount the file system to make modifications. In this case, let's remove the setup.app:  
   - Mount the file system with read/write access using: mount -o rw,union,update /
   - Rename the Setup.app to Setup.bak and then remove it:  
     mv /Applications/Setup.app /Applications/Setup.bak  
     rm -rf /Applications/Setup.app
5. After modifying the file system, clear the cache and restart Springboard:  
   - Clear the cache using: uicache --all  
   - Restart Springboard with: killall backboardd
6. Following these steps should achieve the desired modifications.
